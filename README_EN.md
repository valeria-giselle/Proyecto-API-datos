# 📡 Data API Project

## 📌 Description
The goal of this project is to practice common software engineering tasks
applied to data-related workflows, in order to strengthen technical skills
and enhance a Data Analyst profile.

The project focuses on building a web application that exposes data through
an API, as well as setting up and managing Python virtual environments and
deploying the service to a production environment.

Although a dataset of car sales advertisements is used, the main focus of
the project is not data analysis, but the development and deployment of the
API as an accessible data source.

## 🧠 Objective
- Practice data exposure through an API
- Build a simple web application using Python
- Manage dependencies and virtual environments
- Deploy a functional API to a production environment

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `api/` → Main script for API consumption
- `data/` → Datasets used in the analysis
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebook
- `README.md` → Project description in Spanish
- `README_EN.md` → Project description in English
- `requirements.txt` → Project dependencies

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- Requests
- VS Code
- Render (deployment)

## 🌐 Deployed API

The API is deployed and publicly available at the following link:

🔗 https://proyecto-sprint7-a5yh.onrender.com/

This endpoint can be accessed directly from a browser or tools such as Postman.

## 📈 What the API Does
- Exposes an endpoint that retrieves data from an external source
- Returns data in JSON format
- Allows validating the API functionality without local execution

## 💡 Use Case
This API can be used as a data source for exploratory analysis, dashboards,
or integration with other applications.

## 📌 Notes
This project demonstrates API consumption and deployment in a production
environment using Render.
