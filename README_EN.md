# 📡 Project – API Data Consumption

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates how to consume data from an external API.

The main goal is to connect to an API, retrieve data, and prepare it
for exploratory analysis using Python.

## 🧠 Objective
The vehicle web application allows users to interactively explore data on vehicles for sale in the United States. It offers features such as price histogram generation and scatter plots that show the relationship between price and mileage. Users can visualize patterns and trends in the data, with interactive options to uncover additional details. Furthermore, it includes intuitive tools, such as a button that enables specific actions, providing a dynamic and user-friendly experience. It is ideal for data analysis and informed decision-making.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- `api/` → Main script for API consumption
- `data/` → Datasets used in the analysis
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebook
- `README.md` → Project description in Spanish
- `README_EN.md` → Project description in English
- `requirements.txt` → Project dependencies

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- Requests
- Pandas

## 📈 What the API Does
- Exposes an endpoint that retrieves data from an external source
- Returns data in JSON format
- Allows validating the API functionality without local execution

## 💡 Use Case
This API can be used as a data source for exploratory analysis, dashboards,
or integration with other applications.

## 📌 Notes
This project demonstrates API consumption and deployment in a production
environment using Render.
